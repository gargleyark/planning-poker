# Planning Poker 2023

## Problem statement

My favourite planning poker isn't free any more.

## Overview

I built this on a train

It probably works, but could do with typescript, tests, etc, and there's no nodemon to make development easier

#-- Setup and start the server
cd server
npm install # or yarn install
npm start # or yarn start

```
